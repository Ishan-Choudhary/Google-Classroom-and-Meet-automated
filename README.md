# Google-Classroom-and-Meet-automated
I have automated my entering of class into google classroom and google meet. I have use the pynput and the webbrowser module. I did not opt for selenium with python as it would require us to install the chromedriver.exe, where the cache is lost as soon as the program ends. This would mean that each and every time we would have to login into our gmail account and then go and enter the classroom. Also the code would be longer therfore to shorten it I have used shortcut keys. (First Commit)
